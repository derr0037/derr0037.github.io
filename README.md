Reflection

While writing the code for the project, one of the issues that I faced was items overlapping eachother when the viewport switches from medium to large. I was able to overcome this by using grid rather than flex, so that as the screen gets bigger/smaller the items withing the grid stay the same width relative to the viewport size. Another issue I encountered was adding multiple lines to an input element in a form (for a message), however I was unable to overcome this. I believe I learned how to better combine grid and flex layouts in order to see a fluid responsive resize, and overall deepened my understanding of how each each layout option functions. I also became familiar with custom libraries through the use of the root pseudo-class, and gained a deeper understanding of the main and cross axis in a flexbox.
